# elm-faster-benchmark

This is a small library for running fast benchmarks using Web Workers. To use it, copy the `template` directory, change `ToBenchmark.elm` as needed, then `make` and use the results in `dist`.

It's very rough and the API is an MVP, get in touch with me (on the Elm Slack) with your needs so I can expose better APIs.
